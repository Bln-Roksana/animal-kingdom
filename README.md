# Animal Sound Board

A project that was initially done as a part of my Udemy course. I decided to create someting aimed at little ones and re-designed into animal sound board.
Keep clicking the animal and you will notice it plays a random sound from an array.
Pressing down the first letter of the animal name also works!
